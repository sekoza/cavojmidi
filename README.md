# CavojMidi

CavojMidi is a web-based interactive music training application
built with JavaScript and the Web MIDI API.

It demonstrates real-world usage of:
- **Web MIDI API** for MIDI input/output in the browser,
- **event handling and timing** in JavaScript,
- **music interaction logic** entirely in client-side code.

## Features

- Practice melodies at different difficulty levels
- Customize tempo and key
- Use standard MIDI devices or virtual MIDI inputs
- Real-time interaction powered by JavaScript

This project can serve both as:
- a useful tool for musicians, and
- a learning resource for developers exploring Web MIDI
  and advanced browser JavaScript techniques.
